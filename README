Random tools for interacting with a Condor pool -

job_rates.sh will give exit rate information, providing information
about how many jobs are completed by a condor_schedd per second, and
if the schedd is getting backed up.

LogTimeGap.awk will find gaps in log files, typically not something
you'll see in a busy pool. Try using it with tail -F.

NegotiatorLog.awk will provide performance information for a
negotiation cycle. Note, in versions of Condor >=7.6, many of these
statistics can be found on the condor_negotiator's ad, via
condor_status -negotiator -long.
