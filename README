Random tools for interacting with a Condor pool -

job_rates.sh will give exit rate information, providing information
about how many jobs are completed by a condor_schedd per second, and
if the schedd is getting backed up.

LogTimeGap.awk will find gaps in log files, typically not something
you'll see in a busy pool. Try using it with tail -F.

NegotiatorLog.awk will provide performance information for a
negotiation cycle. Note, in versions of Condor >=7.6, many of these
statistics can be found on the condor_negotiator's ad, via
condor_status -negotiator -long.

utilization.sh will calculate pool utilization from slot data. For
example,
          Unavailable Available    Total     Used:  Avail   Total
   Slots         5857      5597    11454     4766  85.15%  41.60%
   Cpus          6339      5913    12252     5087  86.03%  41.51%
   Memory    14330280  11786518 26116798 10698334  90.76%  40.96%

clock_skew.sh will display machines whose clock skew is outside a 60
second window from the Collector. NTP is your friend.

limits_usage.sh will display concurrency limits that are in use and
information about their usage.
