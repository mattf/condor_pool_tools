Random tools for interacting with a Condor pool -

job_rates.sh will give exit rate information, providing information
about how many jobs are completed by a condor_schedd per second, and
if the schedd is getting backed up.

LogTimeGap.awk will find gaps in log files, typically not something
you'll see in a busy pool. Try using it with tail -F.

NegotiatorLog.awk will provide performance information for a
negotiation cycle. Note, in versions of Condor >=7.6, many of these
statistics can be found on the condor_negotiator's ad, via
condor_status -negotiator -long.

utilization.sh will calculate pool utilization from slot data. For
example,
          Unavailable Available    Total     Used:  Avail   Total
   Slots         5857      5597    11454     4766  85.15%  41.60%
   Cpus          6339      5913    12252     5087  86.03%  41.51%
   Memory    14330280  11786518 26116798 10698334  90.76%  40.96%

utilization_for_opentsdb.sh generates the same data as utilization.sh,
but provides it in a form suitable for publishing to OpenTSDB
(http://opentsdb.net).

clock_skew.sh will display machines whose clock skew is outside a 60
second window from the Collector. NTP is your friend.

limits_usage.sh will display concurrency limits that are in use and
information about their usage.

group_share.sh will display current AccountingGroup usage from slot
data. For example,
   Used ( Avail) Group
      2 ( 0.73%) 
      3 ( 1.09%) jane.lover
     10 ( 3.65%) jane.hater
     15 ( 5.47%) jeff.freakout
     19 ( 6.93%) sally.normal
     20 ( 7.30%) patrick.normal
     21 ( 7.66%) steve.normal
     24 ( 8.76%) jane.mad
     61 (22.26%) steve.longwinded
     63 (22.99%) susan.normal
    238  86.86% - Total

condor_jobrates will display statistics for condor_schedds with
running jobs in a pool. For example,
          Schedd    Job    Job    Current Historical    Current Historical
                 Starts  Compl   Runtimes   Runtimes   Idletime   Idletime
                   /sec   /sec      (sec)      (sec)      (sec)      (sec)
    eeyore.local   3.95   4.38       36.7       45.5        8.8      990.4

schedd_stats_for_opentsdb.sh generates the condor_jobrates data, plus
total idle/running/held counts, and provides it in a form suitable for
publishing to OpenTSDB (http://opentsdb.net).

group_line.rb will display AccountingGroup usage, combined with
configured shares and current job load. For example,
  Group          Used    Avail   Config     Diff    Idle
